# Storybook Deployment issue

### Overview

We are facing an issue with our Storybook when it's deployed. While it works perfectly in a local environment, the deployed version throws errors that prevent it from loading correctly. We are currently using Storybook version 7.4.2.

#### Error Observed
#### 1. JSON Sytanx Error
  The story book view error button shows the following error
```javascript
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
``` 
#### 2. Infinite Loading Issue
Upon running the production build of storybook-static using the serve command, the browser does not load the Storybook UI as expected. Instead, it gets stuck on an infinite loading icon.

The browser console logs the following error:
```javascript
chunk-SPUAGIB2.js:1 manager received preloadStories but was unable to determine the source of the event

```

### Steps to Reproduce
- Deploy the Storybook to [deployment environment or server].
- Open the Storybook URL in a web browser.
- Observe the aforementioned errors in the browser console.

### Additional Notes
- The issue does not appear when running Storybook locally.
- The specific environment details, configurations, and any recent changes made that could potentially influence this behavior.
- We are using the latest version of Storybook, which is 7.4.2.
